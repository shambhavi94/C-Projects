I worked on this project in order to learn how to code a linux kernel module, and write a module that will enable me to install a linux device driver, i.e. creating a device file and testig the driver code.

Navigate to the directory containing the multi-lookup program

Folders:

input: names*.txt (contains all the input files to run the program)

Build:

$ make
 
Clean:

$ make clean

Run Program:

$ ./multi-lookup input/names*.txt input/names*.txt input/names*.txt results.txt

The first three arguments are the THREE file names to run the program with, you can select any three from the ones located in the 'input' directory.
Replace the '*' in 'input/names*.txt' with the actual number contained in the file name. 
the final argument is the output file, you can name this whatever you would like. The program will right your results to this file.
