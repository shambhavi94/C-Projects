In this assingment, I learned how to compile and install a modern linux kernel, as well as how to add a custom system call.
Simple_add.c includes the definition of System call, I defined for my test program.
	- This file will be in /home/kernel/linux-4.4.0/arch/x86/kernel

MakeFile includes build functionality about our kernel call. It has Simple_add.o in it.
	- This file will be in /home/kernel/linux-4.4.0/arch/x86/kernel

syscall_64.tbl includes the referencing the system call in the system table. check index 1123 to see the system call.
	- This file will be in /home/kernel/linux-4.4.0/arch/x86/entry/syscalls

syscalls.h is the header file for system call.
	- This file will be in /home/kernel/linux-4.4.0/include/linux

syslog file gives you the log of the program that runs in kernel space.
	- This file will be in /var/log

Test_add.c in the test file. 

Running the program- 

1) use gcc -o example Test_add.c 
2) ./example (running this command will give you the output of addition of two numbers added in the terminal)
3) To see the output printk use- sudo tail /var/log/syslog or dmesg.
